    value: "<p>A license plate reassignment is done when a customer leases a vehicle and wishes to retain possession of his or her current plate. In this case, the plate would be reassigned to the leasing company. A plate can also be reassigned from a leasing company to an individual, or from one leasing company to another. A reassignment can only be done for a newly purchased or leased vehicle, and an RMV-1 form must be used. A plate can only be reassigned when a lease is involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please see reverse side for instructions. Fax completed form to 857-368-0819.</strong></p>\r\n"
